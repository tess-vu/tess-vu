I'm an interdisciplinary individual who dabbles in research, and whose work sits at the intersection of GeoAI, environmental health, and urban systems. As a first-generation student, my path into research has been nonlinear — shaped not by a single discipline, but by a persistent curiosity about how data, place, and equity interact. Drawing from a background in environmental studies, spatial analytics, and machine learning, I design computational tools that make hidden forms of risk visible: from emerging contaminants in Philadelphia’s water system, to heat exposure in Saigon, to quality-of-life disparities revealed through 311 data in New York City.

My work integrates field-based sampling, remote sensing, deep learning, spatial statistics, and civic technology. I've built systems that used PSPNet and ADE20K to conduct Google Street View image segmentation of urban greenery and the built environment in order to inversely optimize for the hottest-route using XGBoost and Dijkstra's algorithm; I've also quantified environmental inequities and injustices through spatial econometric modeling. Before graduate school, I worked in telecommunications as a network engineer designing cable routes throughout cities, in cancer research as an associate preparing blood and other biohazardous specimens as well as handling sensitive health data, and often found myself participating in local community advocacy. All of these experiences and my childhood in stratified neighborhoods shaped my commitment to producing science that is technically rigorous and grounded in lived experience, and in those journeys also consistently challenge my own preconcieved notions.

Across every project, I want to bring a reflective, systems-oriented approach: using data not just to predict, but to understand, explain, and intervene.
